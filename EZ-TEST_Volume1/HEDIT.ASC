                              TEK EZ-TEST                             4105 Terminal                 EDIT FUNCTIONS MENU - HELP INFORMATION  KEY F1:  LIST STEPS             Lists  all  or  part  of  the  procedure by step.  You are            prompted for beginning and ending step  numbers  to  list,            and   can   use   <control-S>  to  stop  the  listing  and            <control-Q> to continue.    KEY F2:  DUPLICATE STEP             Use of this key will permit the duplicating  a  preveously            created step.  Certain parameters can then be changed with            the use of the ALTER STEP key.    KEY F3:  REPLACE STEP             Performs the equivalent of the DELETE and ADD step keys.    KEY F4:  INSERT STEP             Lets  you  insert  a step between two existing steps.  All            steps between the insert point and the  next  unused  step            will  be  renumbered (along with branch information).  All            steps thereafter will retain their original step  numbers.            Any  steps  that  are  renumbered  or  that  branch  to  a            renumbered step will  be  traced.   Trace  information  is            provided on a printout from the 4041 strip printer.  After            renumbering  occurs (if any), you can perform the ADD step            function.    KEY F5:  NEW STEP             Is used to generate a new step.  Any step  number  can  be            chosen  within the range of 1 to 100 (an error is reported            if the step  number  is  already  used).   An  AUTO-NUMBER            feature is also available in lieu of a step number entry.             You must choose the type of step to generate.                Choose: S  Single step (one new step)                      L  Loop step (For/Next increment steps)                      G  GOSUB step (GOSUB to a subprocedure of steps)                      R  RETURN step (RETURN from a subprocedure)            You will be prompted for BRANCH SEQUENCING information for            each  step  generated.   The default is to continue to the            next step in numerical order.    KEY F6:  ALTER STEP             Permits you  to  alter  an  existing  step;  you  will  be            prompted  for  a step number.  For single-type steps, lets            you  alter:   label,  units,  acquisition  limits,   pause            interval,  panel  mode  (lockout  or  local),  and  branch            sequencing.   For  loop  steps,  only  the  label  can  be            altered.   This  function  does  not apply to GOSUB/RETURN            steps.    KEY F7:  HELP             Generates this  HELP  information  from  the  TEK  EZ-TEST            software  if  the  appropriate  medium  is inserted in its            drive.    KEY F8:  MAIN MENU             Returns to MAIN MENU.    KEY S1:  HARDCOPY LIST STEPS             Permits you to list all or parts of  the  procedure  on  a            printer  or  other device attached to the 4041 Option 1 or            Option 3 RS-232C data  comm  port  (comm1).   The  current            parameters  are  presented  and  you are allowed to modify            them.  Enter only stream specifications  for  comm1.   You            will  be  prompted  for physical parameters first and then            for logical parameters  (see  4041  Programmers  Reference            Manual - Appendix D).              For example:                      PHYSICAL PARAMETERS:                          BAUD=1200  (or the rate the printer is set for)                     FLA=BID    (bi-directional flagging prevents                                 printer buffer overflow)                      LOGICAL PARAMETERS:                          CR=CR      (set carriage return for cr only)  KEY S2:  DELETE STEPS             Use  of  this  key  will remove one or more steps from the            procedure.  Enter one number to delete  one  step  or  two            numbers  to delete a group of steps.  Pressing RETURN will            not delete any step.  The space created by deleting  steps            can be used for other steps.    Copyright (c) 1984 Tektronix Inc.
