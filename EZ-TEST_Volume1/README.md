My 'newest' 4041 included the DDU disk drive unit and had a Tektronix MP2501 sticker below the tape slot on the 4041, but the hard disk did not work and no tapes or floppy disks were supplied with the unit I purchased this year (2020).  I did get my DDU working by replacing both the SCSI hard disk and SCSI floppy drive.

The EZ-TEST Vol1 and Vol2 tapes were in set of eleven 4041 tapes were packed in a box of 4052 tapes that I purchased from Stan Griffiths in 2000.
EZ-TEST Vol1 was not readable, but there was a copy of it that I could partially read.
