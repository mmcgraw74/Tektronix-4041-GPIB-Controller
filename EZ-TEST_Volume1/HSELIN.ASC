                                EZ-TEST                             4105 Terminal              INSTRUMENT SELECTION MENU - HELP INFORMATION  General Information:              Allows  you  to  choose  any  instrument supported by this            software if it is resident on the GPIB.  Once a model  has            been  chosen,  you  are  presented  with a list of all the            addresses on the GPIB where that instrument is found.   If            there  are multiple instruments of any model active on the            bus, you must select one from  a  list  of  addresses  and            ports.              The  OPERATING  MODES  menu is presented after the desired            instrument is selected from the list.    KEY F1 DC 5009/DC 5010 Counter/Timer   KEY F2 2445/2465 Portable Oscilloscope   KEY F3 DM 5010 Multi-meter   KEY F4 FG 5010 Function Generator   KEY F5 PS 5010 Power Supply   KEY F6 MI 5010 Multi-function Interface with cards                      50M10 ADC                     50M20 DAC                     50M30 DIO                     50M40 RSC                     50M41 LLRSC                     50M50 MEMORY                     50M70 DEV     KEY F7 SI 5010 RF Signal Scanner   KEY F8 EDIT MENU (return to EDIT MENU)   KEY S1 AA 5001 Audio Distortion Analyzer   KEY S2 SG 5010 160kHz Oscillator   KEY S3 CG 5001 Scope Cal Generator (or CG 551AP)   KEY S4 PS 5004 POWER SUPPLY   KEY S5 7D20 PROGRAMMABLE DIGITIZER   KEY S6 XX-INSTRUMENT any GPIB instrument (see restrictions)   KEY S7 OPERATOR PROMPT             Generates a  procedure  step  prompting  the  operator  to            perform  an  operation  or to provide input.  Operator may            provide numerical data or make PASS/FAIL  judgements.Lines            can  be  delimited with <return>; the entire entry must be            terminated with <line feed>.  Tab stops are preset  at  1,            9,  17,  25,  33,  41, 49, 57, 65, 73, and 80.  The entire            prompt entry is limited to 500 characters including spaces            and delimiters.    KEY S8 HELP (this HELP information)                           OPERATING MODES MENU  GENERAL INFORMATION             Presented after instrument is selected to let  you  choose            specific  instrument  functions.   The following functions            can be used as often as desired:  LEARN SETTINGS, KEYBOARD            INPUT, LOCK or UNLOCK PANEL, TALK/LISTEN, and  SET  DELAY.            The  following  functions  may  be used only once; after a            step is completed with these keys, the EDIT menu  returns:            MAKE  MEASUREMENT,  ACQUIRE  BLOCK,  ACQUIRE WAVEFORM, and            EDIT MENU.    KEY F1 LEARN SETTINGS             Learns front panel settings from the instrument  presently            selected.  Uses the front panel INST ID button or the next            press of this key to initiate the learn operation.  Either            ASCII  or  BINARY  settings  may be learned from TEKTRONIX            instruments.  This key may be used  as  often  as  desired            (replaces previous learned settings, however).    KEY F2 KEYBOARD INPUT             Allows  you  to enter instrument commands via the terminal            keyboard.  These commands  are  appended  to  any  learned            settings  from  key  1 above and the full setup is sent to            the  instrument  for  verification.   If  any  errors  are            reported by the instrument, the commands are discarded and            you  can  try  again  with  keys 1 & 2. Command errors are            reported only for TEKTRONIX instruments.  This key can  be            used  as many times as desired (replaces previous keyboard            input, however).    KEY F3 SET DELAY             Permits  you  to  designate  pause  intervals  in  seconds            (resolution of 10ms).  For stimulus instruments, the pause            interval  will  occur  after  the instrument settings have            been sent.  For measurement instruments,  the  pause  will            occur   between   the   instrument  command  (if  one  was            specified) and the acquisition of data.    KEY F4 MAKE MEASUREMENT             Acquires a measurement from the  instrument.   Acquisition            occurs  after any instrument commands have been sent.  You            will be prompted for an acquisition timeout; default is 10            seconds.   PASS/FAIL  limits   may   be   designated   for            comparison  during  procedure execution.  PASS/FAIL limits            are not  permitted  for  loop  steps.   Use  of  this  key            terminates generation of the step.    KEY F5 ACQUIRE BLOCK (all instruments except 7D20)             Generates  a  data block acquisition  step.  A maximum 10k            byte block of 8-bit data is  acquired  from  the  selected            instrument  and  stored  on a tape or disk file.  Selected            instrument must have been prompted to send the data  in  a            prior step.              During  step  generation,  the device is addressed to talk            and data acquired as if actually running a test; this lets            you determine the required data file size.  You  are  then            prompted for a file name and size, after which the program            returns to the EDIT menu.              When executed, the device is addressed to talk and data is            transfered  directly to the file.  The data storage format            is:  Device ID string <cr> Step  label  string  <cr>  data            block string <cr> <eof>.              ACQUIRE WAVEFORM (7D20 only)             Generates  a  waveform acquisition  step.   A  waveform is            transferred from the 7D20 and stored in  a  tape  or  disk            file.   Any set-up required for the 7D20 must be done in a            prior step.              During step generation, the waveform  is  plotted  on  the            terminal  screen  to  let  you verify the data is correct.            The required file size will be  printed  on  the  terminal            screen, then you will be prompted for a file name and size            and a measurement label.              When  executed, the waveform is sent to the storage device            in the following format:  Device ID string <cr> Step label            string <cr> Waveform preamble string  <cr>  Waveform  data            array <cr> <eof>.    KEY F6 UNLOCK (LOCK) PANEL             Lets    you    select    between    front   panel   states            Remote with Lockout and Local .  Key  label  and  function            alternate  when  the  key  is pressed.  Normal mode during            execution is Remote  with  Lockout  (label  reads  UNLOK);            Local  mode lets you alter the front panel settings during            execution.   The  software   automatically   returns   the            instrument  to  the  lockout  state  when  addressed  in a            subsequent step or if serial polled.    KEY F8 EDIT MENU             Causes you to be prompted through a list of  questions  to            determine  BRANCHING  information  relevant  to  the  next            procedure step to run.  The generation of the current step            is then complete and the EDIT menu is re-entered.    Copyright (c) 1984 Tektronix Inc.
