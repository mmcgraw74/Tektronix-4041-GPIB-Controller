                              TEK EZ-TEST                             4105 Terminal                       MAIN MENU HELP INFORMATION  KEY F1:  EDIT PROCEDURE             Calls  up the EDIT menu to allow you to generate procedure            steps and list them on the terminal or line printer.  EDIT            functions include ADD, ALTER, DELETE, REPLACE, and INSERT.  KEY F2:  GET PROCEDURE             Retrieves a procedure  previously  created  with  the  TEK            EZ-TEST  software.   You are presented with a directory of            the tape (or disk) currently installed  and  are  prompted            for a file name.    KEY F3:  SAVE PROCEDURE             Stores  a  TEK  EZ-TEST  generated procedure on a file you            designate.   Presents  you  with  a  file  directory   and            provides  safeguards  against  inadvertent  destruction of            other valuable files.  Triggers a 4041 printer copy of the            file  name  and  list  of  instruments  (port  number  and            address) for future reference.    KEY F4:  FILE UTILITIES             Presents a menu of file utility options.  You can elect to            Delete  a  file, Rename a file, Format a new tape or disk,            re-format a tape or disk,  or  send  a  directory  to  the            terminal or thermal strip printer.    KEY F5:  NEW PROCEDURE             Destroys  any  procedure  currently in the computer memory            and allows you to alter the configuration  of  instruments            on the GPIB.  Performs a test of all bus ports and devices            and  learns  which  instruments are available for the next            procedure creation session.  You are first asked to verify            that you really want to do this.    KEY F6:  TERMINATE PROGRAM             Permits you to terminate the software program.  Leaves the            4041 in Immediate Mode  if  PD  ROMS  are  installed.   To            restart  the  software  you must enter RUN on the terminal            keyboard.  This key will destroy any procedure  stored  in            the  computer  memory.   If  this  key is pressed, you are            asked to verify that you  really  want  to  terminate  the            creation session.    KEY F7:  HELP             Generates  this  HELP  information  from  the  TEK EZ-TEST            software if the appropriate  medium  is  inserted  in  its            drive.    KEY F8:  EXECUTE PROCEDURE             Calls  up  the  TEST  EXECUTION MENU to allow you to run a            procedure resident in memory or retrieved from  your  data            base.    KEY S4:  SYSTEM DEVICE             Allows  you  to change the system device from the standard            magnetic tape drive to  a  disk  device  attached  to  the            4041's  SCSI port.  The 4041 must have option 03 installed            or this function key will not be active and the label will            not appear.  Rear panel switches on the 4041 must  be  set            correctly  or  error  messages will appear when you try to            change   system   devices.    The   manual   lists    SCSI            implementations supported.    Copyright (c) 1984 Tektronix, Inc.
