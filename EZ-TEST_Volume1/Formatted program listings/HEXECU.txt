                                EZ-TEST                             4105 TERMINAL                 TEST EXECUTION MENU - HELP INFORMATION  KEY F1 SETUP TEST             Prompts if you want to retrieve procedures from the system            storage  device.   Prompts  if  you  want  to link several            procedure files (10 max).  Prompts you for file name(s) of            procedure(s)  to  retrieve.   Prompts   you   for   device            (printers,  screen,  or  tape file) on which to store test            results table(s).              Prompts you for:  Operator Name, Test Device  ID  Name  or            Number, and Operator Interactive Testing (Y or N)             Operator  Interactive  Testing  permits remedial action in            the case of measurements which fail limits (if any).   See            Failure Prompting menu.    KEY F2 RUN TEST             Begins execution of test procedure currently in memory.    KEY F3 STEP TEST             Executes  the  test procedure in STEP mode.  Allows you to            initiate each step of the procedure  with  each  press  of            this key when prompted to do so.  This mode is most useful            when checking the correctness of a test procedure.    KEY F4 RUN LINK             Begins execution of the procedure files designated with F1            SETUP TEST key.  No action is taken if a list has not been            generated  with  key F1.  If required equipment is missing            for a procedure, that procedure will be skipped.    KEY F5 STORE DATA             Permits you to send  acquired  test  data  to  any  system            device  for  viewing or storage.  Partial test data may be            viewed  in  this  manner  if   a   test   has   terminated            prematurely.    KEY F6 PULSE PARAMETERS             Retrieves,  plots,  and  calculates  pulse parameters of a            7D20 waveform stored on a tape or disk file as a result of            waveform acquisition.  Permits you to specify the  segment            of   the  waveform  and  conditions  for  pulse  parameter            analysis.  Lists parameters on the screen and on the  4041            thermal printer if desired.    KEY F7 PLOT LOOPS             Plots loop test data generated by a procedure currently in            memory.  Presents you with a menu of loop steps with valid            data.   Plots  the  acquired data on the vertical axis and            stimulus data on the horizontal axis.    KEY F8 MAIN MENU             Returns to MAIN MENU.    KEY S1 LOG FAIL (LOG ALL)             Changes data logging modes on alternate key strokes.  When            LOG FAIL is selected, only acquisitions that  fail  limits            are  logged.   Measurements  with no limits are considered            passing.  When LOG ALL is selected, all  acquisitions  are            logged.    KEY S2 RUN SEGMENT             Permits  you to designate a test step or a segment of test            steps to execute.  No test steps will be executed  outside            the  range  designated  except for sub-procedures (GOSUBs)            called from within the designated range.   Execution  will            terminate  with  the  last step and data will be available            for inspection via key F5.    KEY S5 RETRIEVE DATA             Permits you to retrieve test data or BLOCK ACQR data  from            a  file.   The  data may be sent to the terminal screen or            comm port 1 line printer.  Test data may also be read into            memory, which would allow you to plot  loop  data  on  the            terminal  screen.   CAUTION:   BLOCK ACQR data may contain            non-printing   ASCII   characters    which    can    cause            unpredictable  results  when  sent  to  the  ANSI terminal            screen or to a line printer.    KEY S8 HELP (this HELP information)                          FAILURE PROMPTING MENU            This menu will be called up if the operator  has  selected            OPERATOR  INTERACTIVE TESTING with KEY F1 SETUP TEST and a            test has failed its programmed limits at execution time.              Since MEASUREMENT LOOP tests do not allow limits  testing,            a  failure  cannot  occur  and  the  measurement loop test            procedure will complete to the end of the loop.    KEY F5 CONTINUE             Continue execution with  the  next  procedure  step  (FAIL            branch  step  if  applicable)  after  being stopped on the            present step by a limits failure.    KEY F6 REPEAT MEASUREMENT             Execute the failed test  again  and  report  results.   If            pass, branch normally; if fail, wait for operator to press            KEY 5 to continue (or any other key in this menu).    KEY F7 AVERAGE MEASUREMENT             Execute  the  failed test the number of times specified by            the operator and log the  average  of  all  test  results.            Wait  for  the operator to press KEY 5 to continue (or any            other key in this menu).    KEY F8 ABORT TEST             Stop execution of the test procedure.  Return to the  TEST            EXECUTION  MENU.   The acquisition data table will contain            data for all steps executed to this point.    Copyright (c) 1984 Tektronix Inc.
