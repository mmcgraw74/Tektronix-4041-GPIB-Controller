0Somewhere nearby is Colossal Cave.  Where others have foundfortunes in treasure and gold.  Though it is rumored thatsome who enter are never seen again.  Magic is said to workin the cave.  I will be your eyes and hands.  Direct me withcommands of 1 or 2 words.  I should warn you that I look atonly the first five letters of each word.  So you'll have toenter 'northeast' as 'ne' to distinguish it from 'north'.    This program was developed by Willie Crowther and Don Woods.  This is a 300 point version abridged for PET disk byJim Butterfield and ported to Tektronix 4041 by Monty McGraw  Z1I know of Places, Actions, and Things.  Most of myvocabulary describes places and is used to move you there.  To move, try words like building, enter, East, West, North,South, Up, or Down.  I know about a few special objects,like a black rod hidden in the cave.  These objects can bemanipulated using some of the action words that I know.  Usually you will need to give both the object and actionwords.  But sometimes I can infer the object from the verbalone.  Some objects also imply verbs: in particular,'inventory' implies 'take inventory'.  Which causes me togive you a list of what you're carrying.  Z2The objects have side effects: for instance, the rod scaresthe bird.  Usually people having trouble moving just need totry a few more words.  Usually people trying unsuccessfullyto manipulate an object are trying something beyond their(or my!) capabilities and should try a completely differenttack.  To speed the game you can sometimes move long distanceswith a single word.      For example: 'building'usually gets you to the building from anywhere above groundexcept when lost in the forest.  Also, note that cave passages turn a lot.And that leaving a room to the northdoes not guarantee entering the next from the south.  Good Luck!  Z3Maximum points are earned by leavingtreasure in the building.  It alsohelps to get back out in one piece.    If you think you have found all thetreasure, keep moving around untilsomething happens.    Special commands:     quit, end, or stop - ends game look  - lets you look at a location short - gives short descriptions brief - short descriptions, except         when you say look score - gives your current score save  - saves your current game load  - restores a saved game help  - repeats these instructions  Z
