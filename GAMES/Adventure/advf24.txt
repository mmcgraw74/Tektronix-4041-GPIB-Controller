0You're in a large room carved out of sedimentary rock.The floor and walls are littered with bits of shellsembedded into the stone.  A shallow passage proceedsdownward, and a somewhat steeper one leads up.  A lowhands and knees passage enters from the south.Z1You are in an arched hall.  A coral passage once continuedup and east from here, but is now blocked by debris.The air smells of sea water.Z2You are in a long sloping corridor with ragged sharp walls.Z3You are in a cul-de-sac about eight feet across.Z4You are in bedquilt.A long east/west passage with holes everywhere.To explore at random:  select up down north or south.Z5You are in a room whose walls resemble swiss cheese.Obvious passages go west east ne and nw.  Part of theroom is occupied by a large bedrock block.Z6You are in the soft room.  The walls are covered withheavy curtains.  The floor with a thick pile carpet.Moss covers the ceiling.Z7You are at the east end of the twopit room.  The floorhere is littered with thin rock slabs, which make iteasy to descend the pits.  There is a path here bypassingthe pits to connect with passages from east and west.  Thereare holes all over  but the only big one is on the walldirectly over the west pit where you can't get to it.Z8You are at the west end of the twopit room.There is a large hole in the wall above the pitat this end of the room.Z9You are at the bottom of the eastern pit in the twopit room.There is a small pool of oil in one corner of the pit.Z
