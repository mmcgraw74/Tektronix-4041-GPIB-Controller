0You are in a 20 foot depression floored with bare dirt.  Setinto the dirt is a strong steel grate mounted in concrete.A dry streambed leads into the depression.Z1You are in a small chamber beneath a 3 by 3 steel grate tothe surface.  A low crawl over cobbles leads inward to thewest.Z2You are crawling over cobbles in a low passage.  There isa dim light at the east end of the passage.Z3You are in a debris room filled with stuff washed in fromthe surface.  A low wide passage with cobbles, becomesplugged with mud and debris here.  But an awkward canyonleads upward and west.  A note on the wall says:'magic word  xyzzy'.Z4You are in an awkward sloping east/west canyon.Z5You are in a splendid chamber 30 feet high.  The walls arefrozen rivers of orange stone.  An awkward canyon and a goodpassage exit from east and west sides of the chamber.Z6At your feet is a small pit breathing traces of white mist.An east passage ends here except for a small crack leadingon.Z7You are at one end of a vast hall stretching forward out ofsight to the west.  There are openings to either side.Nearby a wide stone staircase leads downward.  The hallis filled with wisps of white mist swaying to and froalmost as if alive.  A cold wind blows up the staircase.There is a passage to the top of a dome behind you.Z8This is a low room with a crude note on the wall.The note says  'You won't get it up the steps!'Z9You are on the east bank of a fissure slicing clear acrossthe hall.  The mist is quite thick here, and the fissureis too wide to jump.Z
