Tektronix 4041 Adventure
----------
My second game is a port of my Tektronix 4052/4054 Adventure64 game to 4041 BASIC
The 4041 needs to have all the files transferred to a tape, floppy disk or hard disk to work.
I have a Windows 10 laptop connected to 4041 COMM0, and using Tera Term terminal emulator program configured for 9600 8N1.

Here is a Tera Term screenshot running Adventure:
