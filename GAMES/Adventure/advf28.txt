0You are in a north/south canyon about 25 feet across.The floor is covered by white mist seeping in from the north.The walls extend upward for well over 100 feet.  Suspendedfrom some unseen point far above you, an enormous two-sidedmirror is hanging parallel to and midway between the canyonwalls.  (the mirror is obviously provided for use by thedwarves, who, as you know, are extremely vain.)  A smallwindow can be seen in either wall, some fifty feet up.Z1You are at the edge of a large underground reservoir.  Anopaque cloud of white mist fills the room and rises rapidlyupward.  The lake is fed by a stream which tumbles out of ahole in the wall about 10 feet overhead and splashes noisilyinto the water somewhere within the mist. The only passagegoes back toward the south.Z2You are in a secret canyon with exits to north and east.Z3You are in a secret e/w canyon above a tight canyon.Z4You are in a wide place in a very tight n/s canyon.Z5The canyon here becomes too tight to go on.Z6You are in a tall e/w canyon.  A low crawl goes three feetnorth and seems to open up.Z7The canyon runs into a maze of boulders--dead end.Z8You are in a maze of twisty little tunnels, all alike.Z
