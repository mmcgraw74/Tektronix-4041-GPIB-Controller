2You're at a low window overlooking a huge pit, which extendsup out of sight.  A floor is indistinctly visible over 50feet below.  Traces of white mist cover the floor of the pit,becoming thicker to the left.  Marks in the dust around thewindow would seem to indicate that someone has been hererecently.  Directly across the pit from you and 25 feet awaythere is a similar window looking into a lighted room.  Ashadowy figure can be seen there peering back at you.Z3You are at the northeast end of an immense room, even largerthan the giant room.  It appears to be a repository for the'adventure' program.  Massive torches far overhead bathe theroom with smoky yellow light.  Scattered about you can beseen a pile of bottles(all of them empty), a nursery of youngbeanstalks murmuring quietly, a bed of oysters,a  bundle ofblack rods with rusty stars on their ends, and a collectionof brass lanterns.  Off to one side a great many dwarves aresleeping on the floor, snoring loudly.  A sign nearby reads'do not disturb the dwarves!'  An immense mirror is hangingagainst one wall, and stretches to the other end of the roomwhere various other sundry objects can be glimpsed dimlyin the distance.Z4You are at the southwest end of the repository.  To one sideis a pit full of fierce green snakes.  On the other side isa row of small wicker cages, each of which contains a littlesulking bird.  In one corner is a bundle of black rods withrusty marks on their ends.  A large number of velvet pillowsare scattered about on the floor.  A vast mirror stretchesoff to the northeast.  At your feet is a large steel grate,next to which is a sign which reads:'Treasure vault.  Keys in main office.'Z
