0Your batteries are starting to run low.  Better wrap it upsoon, unless you can find new ones.  I seem to recall thatthere's a vending machine somewhere in the maze.Z1I am taking the liberty of replacing your batteries.Z2A little dwarf just walked around a corner, saw you, threwa little axe at you which missed, cursed, and ran away.Z3It is now pitch dark.  If you proceed you will likely fallinto a pit.Z4The ming vase drops with a delicate crash.Z5Out from the shadows behind you pounces a bearded pirate!'Har, Har', he chortles, 'I'll just take all this booty andhide it away with me chest deep in the maze!'  He snatchesyour treasure and vanishes into the gloom.Z6The troll catches the axe, examines it, and tosses it back toyou saying,'good workmanship, but not very valuable'.Z7Rubbing the electric lamp is not particularly rewarding.Anyway, nothing exciting happens.Z8You are at the bottom of a pit with a broken neck.Z9Just as you reach the other side, the bridge buckles beneaththe weight of the bear, which was still following you around.You scrabble desperately for support, but as the bridgecollapses you stumble back and fall into the chasm.Z
