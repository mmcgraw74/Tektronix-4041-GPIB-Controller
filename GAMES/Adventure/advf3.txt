Pay Troll!'Z1The bear lumbers toward the troll, who lets out a startledshriek and scurries away.  The bear soon gives up the pursuitand wanders back.Z2The plant spurts into furious growth for a few seconds.Z3The plant grows explosively almost filling the bottom ofthe pit.Z4The bear eagerly wolfs down your food, after which he seemsto calm down considerably and even becomes rather friendly.Z5There's nothing here it wants to eat (except maybe you).Z6Trolls are brothers of the rocks and have skin like that ofa rhinoceros.  He fends off your blows effortlessly.Z7Gluttony is not one of the troll's vices.Avarice, however, is.Z8The bear will bite off your hand.  I wouldn't recommend it.Z9You fool, dwarves eat only coal!Now you've made him *really* mad!!Z
