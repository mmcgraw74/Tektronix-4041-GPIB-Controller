Tektronix 4041 Games 
----------
My first game is a port of my Tektronix 4051 Artillery game to 4041 BASIC
The 4041 needs to have the Graphics ROM for the graphics commands to work.
I have a 4052 Computer connected to 4041 COMM0, and the program configures COMM0 as LU #1

Here is a photo of the 4052 in CALL "TERMIN" terminal mode, running the graphics for the program running on the 4041.
