One serious issue with using the 4041 - 40 years after it was manufactured - is getting the DC100A tapes (30 years since production stopped).  I have purchased NOS 3M DC100A tapes with date codes on the boxes of 1991, and all the tape drive belts in the tapes have broken.  Even worse, the tape belts have stuck to the oxide side of both takeup reels and when the broken belts are removed - the oxide is pulled off the tape completely - which causes the end-of-tape sensor to indicate the tape is unusable.

A DC100A tape can be used to change the 4041 default front panel console to the COMM0: RS-232 port, if you can get one to work, which involves using the front panel keyboard connector and a PC with serial interface to emulate the keyboard to change the console.

A second serious issue with using the 4041 is the lack of the custom 4041 Program Development keyboard, which could be used to type the two 4041 BASIC commands needed to change the default 4041 front panel as the console to the RS-232 COMM0: port standard on every 4041.

After spending several months trying to keep my repaired DC100A tapes working to configure my 4041 console to COMM0: I have come up with a new solution:
